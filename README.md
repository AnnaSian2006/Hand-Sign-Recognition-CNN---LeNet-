# Hand-Sign-Recognition-CNN---LeNet-
Hand sign recognition using LeNet architecture

The main objective of this research is to contribute to the field of automatic sign language recognition by creating a convolutional neural network classifier that can recognize sign language with high accuracy, using vision-based approaches.
The secondary objective is to help and facilitate vocal disabled people to communicate with the outside world.


Technologies used-

Computer simulation and image processing techniques, Combination of feature extraction techniques and, Data Augmentation (data jitter, noise addition, elastic transformation) , CNNs can automatically extract features without manual feature extraction, LeNet

Dataset used-

MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a dataset of handwritten digits.
MNIST sign language (American sign language) data set were chosen to train and test our model . In MNIST sign language data set contain 34,627 images which are made as 24 classes of alphabets exclude J and Z .
